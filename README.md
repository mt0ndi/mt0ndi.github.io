The 'House of Leaves' dashboard visuzalizes the use of different narrators and the use of the word "house" in the critically-acclaimed horror novel "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski. Inspired by the book's unique narrative structure, this dashboard prominently utilizes a spiral chart to reflect themes of madness and descent. This project was built in participation with the Data Visualization Society Mentorsip program.

### Data Structure Overview

Using hashtag#Python, I calculated which of the multiple narrators speaks the most based on font use frequency, as well as the frequency of the word "house" and its page occurrences. Once I had this data, I took it into Tableau.
